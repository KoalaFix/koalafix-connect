## Kalibrate (team memory)
This project uses Kalibrate, the team's shared memory, through the `kalibrate` MCP server.
- At the start of a task: call `recall` with what you are about to do, read the verdict first, then call
  `work` with action `start` naming the task, with its branch, PR or issue as `ref` (or the `paths` you will change) so overlapping work shows up.
- Verdict clear: go. stale: check the source, then `verify`. conflict: stop and show the user both claims.
  unknown: ask the user.
- Learned something durable: `remember`. Confirmed a fact still holds: `verify`.
- When the task is finished: call `work` with action `done`. Call `open` to see what is still open for you.
- `share` and `settle` only with the user's yes.

If a `kalibrate` tool reports that sign-in is needed, ask the user to run `/mcp auth kalibrate`.
